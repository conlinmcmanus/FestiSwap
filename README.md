## MISSION
*Give time and space, a marketplace.*

## OVERVIEW 

People at events sell, buy, or trade things to other people.  (ex.
music festivals, garage sales, motorcycle rallies, fairs...). 
Most events have a specific duration and occur in a specific place. (ex. 2900 block of Washtenaw
Ave, Chicago, IL from 6-8pm).   
It follows that people sell, buy, or trade things to other people at specific times in specific places.  

FestiSwap’s focus will be on event specific classifieds.  It will provide an
event’s attendees virtual digital signage in the form of user generated ads,
enabling artisans, craftspeople, barterers, and buyers at an event to display
information (ex. product descriptions, inventory, interevent location data,
pricing, etc. ) relevant to their offering, whatever that may be.  

Along with the ability for a user to CRUD  (create, read, update, and/or destroy) a
classified ad, we will offer assurance that viewership is specific to other
users at the event to which an offering is tied.  In other words, we will ensure
both the poster of a classified and the reader of a classified are actually
present at the event, during the event.  

## GOAL 
The goal of this project is to create a classifieds app that
incorporates: 

*Geolocating: of users* 

*Geofencing of event marketplaces*

*Timing of event marketplace instantiation and destruction*
